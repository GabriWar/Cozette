# Cozette
A bitmap programming font optimized for coziness.

![sample.png](img/sample.png)

Cozette is based on [Dina][], which itself is based on [Proggy][].
It's also heavily inspired by [Creep][]. I absolutely adore Creep, and was
using it up until I got a higher-DPI screen for which it was slightly too
small - which prompted me to make Cozette.

# Installation

[Check the Releases](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette/releases)!

# Unicode support 

As of release 1.0, these are the characters included in Cozette:

Supporting as many characters as possible is, however, an important objective
for this font, as I'd, ideally, like it to be able to display anything I
might need it to. If you want any additional characters added, just submit
an issue and I'll do my best.

# Roadmap

The eventual goal is feature (and character range)-parity with Creep. Here's
where Cozette is so far, in the order the features are going to be implemented:
 
- [x] ASCII
- [x] Powerline
- [x] Build scripts to handle exporting
- [x] Box-drawing (mostly)
- [x] Braille
- [ ] Nerdfonts:
  - [x] nf-seti-*
  - [ ] nf-dev-*
- [ ] "True" TTF version
- [ ] Bold version
- [ ] Italic version
- [ ] Ligatures
