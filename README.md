# Cozette
A bitmap programming font optimized for coziness.

![sample.png](img/sample.png)

Cozette is based on [Dina][], which itself is based on [Proggy][].
It's also heavily inspired by [Creep][]. I absolutely adore Creep, and was
using it up until I got a higher-DPI screen for which it was slightly too
small - which prompted me to make Cozette.

# Installation

It's 2:47 AM and I'm tired, so right now the only format Cozette is
available in is FontForge's `.sfd`. You figure out how to generate a font
file in the format you want from that. I'm going to add some scripts to
build the distributable fonts tomorrow. 

# Unicode support 

As of now, these are the characters supported by Cozette:

However, supporting as many characters as possible is an important objective
for this font, as I'd, ideally, like it to be able to display anything I
might need it to. If you want any additional characters added, just submit
an issue and I'll do my best.

# Roadmap

The eventual goal is feature (and character range)-parity with Creep. Here's
where Cozette is so far, in the order the features are going to be implemented:
 
- [x] ASCII
- [x] Powerline
- [ ] Build scripts to handle exporting
- [ ] Box-drawing
- [ ] Braille
- [ ] TTF version
- [ ] Bold version
- [ ] Italic version
- [ ] Ligatures
